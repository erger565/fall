Game entry for the JS13KGames competition

# Falling Down
The theme for JS13KGames 2015 was 'reversed'. Being new to the field of JavaScript and HTML5 game development, I decided to do a simple platform-jumper and turn it upside-down.

# How to Play
The game is controlled by mouse only:  
- control the hero by moving the mouse cursor from side to side  
- Use the left button to start and restart the game  
(It may be a good idea to use a mouse and not a touchpad for controlling the game properly)
